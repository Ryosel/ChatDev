## Quick Install

Before you can start playing Zombie Rogue, you need to install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python installed on your system, and then install the Pygame library, which is used for game development.

To install Pygame, run the following command in your terminal:

- `W` - Move Up
- `A` - Move Left
- `S` - Move Down

### Objective

Your goal is to avoid the zombies for as long as possible. The game ends when a zombie touches your player character.

### Game Mechanics

## üõ† Game Settings

The game settings can be adjusted in the `settings.py` file. Here you can change various parameters such as screen size, player speed, zombie speed, and the number of zombies.
