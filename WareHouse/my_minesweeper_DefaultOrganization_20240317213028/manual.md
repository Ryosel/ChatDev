# Minesweeper Game Manual

Welcome to the Minesweeper game developed by ChatDev using the Pygame Library. This manual will guide you through the installation process, introduce you to the main functions of the software, and explain how to play the game.

## Installation

Before you can start playing Minesweeper, you need to ensure that Python and Pygame are installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installing Dependencies

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the Pygame library, which is necessary for running the game.

## Main Functions

The Minesweeper game consists of the following main functions:

- **Game Initialization**: Sets up the game window and initializes game settings.
- **Event Handling**: Manages user inputs such as mouse clicks.
- **Game Loop**: Runs the main loop that updates the game state and renders the board.
- **Board Management**: Handles the logic for the Minesweeper board, including mine placement and cell states.
- **Cell Interaction**: Manages the behavior of each cell on the board, such as revealing and flagging cells.

## How to Play

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start playing Minesweeper by following these steps:

1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. The game window will open, displaying a grid of cells.

3. **Left-click** on a cell to reveal it:
   - If you reveal a mine, the game is over.
   - If you reveal a cell without a mine, it will show the number of adjacent mines.

4. **Right-click** on a cell to flag it if you suspect there's a mine underneath.

5. The goal is to reveal all cells without mines and flag all the mines correctly.

6. The game continues until you either reveal all non-mine cells or click on a mine.

## Tips

- Take your time to think before clicking on a cell.
- Use the numbers revealed by non-mine cells to deduce where mines are likely to be located.
- Flagging all mines correctly is just as important as revealing all non-mine cells.

Enjoy the game, and good luck becoming a Minesweeper champion!

Please ensure that the `requirements.txt` file contains the correct Pygame version to match the game's code compatibility. If the Pygame version is not specified, you can simply use `pygame` in the file, and pip will install the latest version available.
