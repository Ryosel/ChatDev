# Zombie Chase Game Manual

Welcome to the Zombie Chase Game, a thrilling top-down 2D roguelike game where you must navigate through a world overrun by zombies. Your objective is to survive as long as possible, avoiding the relentless horde of zombies that are continuously chasing you. The game ends when a zombie touches you, so stay alert and move quickly!

## Quick Install

Before you can start playing the Zombie Chase Game, you need to install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python installed on your system, and then install the Pygame library, which is used for game development.

To install the Pygame library, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame==2.1.2
```

Alternatively, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
# requirements.txt
pygame==2.1.2
```

And then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Game Controls

To control your player character in the game, use the following keyboard keys:

- `W`: Move up
- `A`: Move left
- `S`: Move down
- `D`: Move right

Your goal is to dodge the zombies and survive for as long as possible.

## Main Functions of the Software

- **Player Movement**: Use the WASD keys to navigate your player around the screen.
- **Zombie AI**: Zombies will continuously chase the player, adjusting their path if obstacles are in the way.
- **Obstacles**: Randomly placed obstacles on the map that both the player and zombies must navigate around.
- **Game Loop**: The game runs in a loop, updating player and zombie positions, checking for collisions, and redrawing the screen.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when a zombie collides with the player.

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have installed Python and Pygame as per the installation instructions above.
2. Download the game files (`main.py`, `player.py`, `zombie.py`, `obstacle.py`) from the provided repository or attachment.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the game files using your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the game by typing `python main.py` and pressing Enter.
5. Use the WASD keys to move your player and avoid the zombies.
6. Try to survive as long as possible!

## Tips for Survival

- Keep moving! Zombies will continuously chase you, so staying in one place is not an option.
- Use obstacles to your advantage. You can temporarily block zombies by maneuvering around obstacles.
- Plan your moves ahead of time. Look for open spaces and paths that give you more room to maneuver.
