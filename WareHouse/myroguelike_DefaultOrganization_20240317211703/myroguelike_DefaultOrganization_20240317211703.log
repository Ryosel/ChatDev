We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

```

In this implementation, we have two files: `main.py` and `game.py`.

The `main.py` file is responsible for initializing the game and running the game loop. It imports the `Game` class from the `game.py` file and creates an instance of it. It then calls the `run` method of the `Game` class to start the game.

The `game.py` file contains the `Game` class that manages the game logic. It initializes the game window using the Pygame library and sets the player's initial position and speed. The `run` method runs the game loop, which handles events, updates the game state based on user input, and renders the game on the screen. The player's position is updated based on the keys pressed by the user, and the game screen is updated and displayed using Pygame functions.

To run the game, you can execute the `main.py` file. The game window will open, and you can use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the player character up, left, down, and right, respectively.

<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one missing import statement in the `main.py` file. The `Game` class from the `game` module needs to be imported in order to create an instance of it.

<Instructions>
To fix this issue, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from game import Game
```

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks good overall, but there is one missing import statement in the `main.py` file. The `Game` class from the `game` module needs to be imported in order to create an instance of it.

<Instructions>
To fix this issue, add the following import statement at the top of the `main.py` file:

```python
from game import Game
```

Once you make this change, the code should work as expected."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `pygame` module in the `game.py` file. This will cause an error when trying to use `pygame` functions and classes.

To fix this, add the following import statement at the beginning of the `game.py` file:

```python
import pygame
```

This will ensure that the `pygame` module is imported and available for use in the `Game` class.

<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `pygame` module in the `game.py` file. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to use `pygame` functions and classes.

To fix this, add the import statement `import pygame` at the top of the `game.py` file, before the `Game` class definition.

Here's the revised code for `game.py`:

```python
'''

    def __init__(self):
        self.running = False

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the necessary import statement for the `pygame` module in the `game.py` file. This will cause a `NameError` when trying to use `pygame` functions and classes.

To fix this, add the import statement `import pygame` at the top of the `game.py` file, before the `Game` class definition.

Here's the revised code for `game.py`:

```python
'''
This file contains the Game class that manages the game logic.
'''
import pygame

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.running = False
        self.display_width = 800
        self.display_height = 600
        self.player_x = self.display_width // 2
        self.player_y = self.display_height // 2
        self.player_speed = 5
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((self.display_width, self.display_height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Roguelike Game")

    def run(self):
        self.running = True
        while self.running:
            self.handle_events()
            self.update()
            self.render()
        pygame.quit()

    def handle_events(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:

        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_w]:
            self.player_y -= self.player_speed

```

Please add the import statement as mentioned above and ensure that the `pygame` module is installed in the Python environment."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly, you can create a `requirements.txt` file in the project's root directory. In this case, since the provided code does not have any external dependencies, you can simply include the `pygame` package in the `requirements.txt` file.

Here's an example of how the `requirements.txt` file should look like:

```
pygame==2.0.1
```

This specifies that the project requires `pygame` version 2.0.1 to be installed. You can add any other dependencies or packages that your project may require in a similar format, with each package on a new line.

Make sure to save the `requirements.txt` file in the same directory as the `main.py` and `game.py` files.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
