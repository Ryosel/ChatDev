Gomoku is a two-player strategy board game played on a square grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game is played on a 15x15 grid, and each player takes turns placing their stones on the intersections of the grid lines.

To play the Gomoku game, follow these steps:

1. The game window will open, displaying an empty game board.

2. Player 1 (Black) starts the game by clicking on an empty intersection on the game board.

3. Player 2 (White) then takes their turn by clicking on another empty intersection.

4. Players continue taking turns until one of them forms an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

5. When a player wins, a message box will appear, indicating the winner (Black or White).

6. To start a new game, close the game window and run the `main.py` file again.
