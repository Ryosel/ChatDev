## Game Overview

The Top-Down 2D Roguelike Game is a simple yet engaging game where you control a player character in a 2D grid environment. The objective is to navigate through the levels, avoiding obstacles and enemies, and survive for as long as possible.

## How to Play

To start the game, run the `main.py` file using Python. You can do this by typing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python main.py
```

Once the game starts, you will see your player character represented by a white square at the center of the screen.

## Controls

Use the following keyboard keys to move your player character:

- `W`: Move up
- `A`: Move left
- `S`: Move down

The game includes diagonal movement, which is normalized to ensure consistent movement speed in all directions. The boundary checking prevents the player from moving outside the game screen.
