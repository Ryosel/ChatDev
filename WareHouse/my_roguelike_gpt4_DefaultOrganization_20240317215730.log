Given the customer's request for a top-down 2D roguelike zombie game that will be developed using the pygame library, the product modality that best fits this task is an 'Application'. This is because the game will require interactive elements, real-time movement, and graphical representation that can only be provided through a software application. The pygame library is specifically designed for writing video games in Python, which makes it the ideal tool for creating our game application. Therefore, I suggest we proceed with developing a game application for this project.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "Develop a top-down 2D roguelike zombie game where a human player can move with w, a, s, d to go up, down, left, and right. Zombie enemies are continuously chasing a player. Furthermore, The game ends when a zombie touches a player. Use pygame library when you make the game.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: "Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Zombie enemies are continuously chasing a player. Furthermore, The game ends when a zombie touches a player. Use pygame library when you make the game..

To begin with, we will need to create several files to structure our game:

1. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of our game, initializing the game loop and handling events.
2. `game.py`: This will contain the main game class that manages the game state.
3. `player.py`: This will define the player class and its movement.
4. `zombie.py`: This will define the zombie class and its AI for chasing the player.
5. `settings.py`: This will contain game settings such as screen dimensions and colors.

Let's start by defining the content of each file.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will discuss and design many decorative images for GUI decoration. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent elements in GUI that are being considered to be decorated by different pictures. For example, ten digits (0-9) in a calculator are functionally independent.
To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements. For example:
'''
button_1.png: The button with the number "1" on it.
button_multiply.png: The button with the multiplication symbol ("*") on it.
background.png: the background color to decorate the Go game
'''
Now, list all functionally independent elements as much as possible.
